In this project, we examine several attack and defense algorithms on machine learning models targeting various at applications in power systems. The attack algorithms we implemented including Fast Gradient Sign Method, Basic Interative Method, Momentum Interative Method, L-BFGS attack, Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack etc. We also tested three defense mechanisms including PCA, Autoencoder and GAN (generative adversarial networks). The discoveries of this project was written in the paper which has been accepted by Power System Computational Conference 2022.

In each folder. the files which are named with numbers are the code for the final submission.
